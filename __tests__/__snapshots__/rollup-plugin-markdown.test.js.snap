"<p>It's fair to say that React 16.8 and the introduction of
<a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\\">hooks</a> has really changed how we
write React. Hooks are one of those APIs that make you realise the flaws of the
previous approach <em>after</em> you stop using it. I remember being very skeptical of
hooks when they were first released, not thinking that the previous class based
design had many flaws, but I've since come to realise I was very wrong, and
hooks are a vast improvement on how we build React components. If you're
interested in comparing the old vs the new, I wrote a
<a href=\\"/refactoring-to-react-hooks/\\">blog post refactoring a component to use hooks</a>
that offers a nice comparison.</p>"
